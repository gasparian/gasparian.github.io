Intro VPNs are primarily designed to create a secure and encrypted connection between your device and a remote server. This connection can be used to protect online privacy, hide your IP address, access geo-restricted content, and enhance security when connecting to the internet, especially on public Wi-Fi networks.</description>

      <title>cProfile</title>

      <description>There are quite some profiling tools for Python, like popular scalene. But I like python for simplicity and really like to use some &amp;ldquo;default&amp;rdquo; tools from the standard python toolchain - so cProfile is my choice.
It doesn&amp;rsquo;t require fine-grained code annotation and very simple to use.
It shows stats on how much time is spent while executing certain functions. Really easy to work and interpret.
Run For example, the following command will run profiling on each function that is being run inside the main.</description>

      <title>OpenCV CUDA on ðŸ›ž`s</title>

      <description>I think we all know opencv - itâ€™s a pretty old yet widely used and performant computer vision library with a lot of useful algorithms. One of the advantages of it - you can configure opencv how you want to get really nice performance gain. One of the ways - compile it to multiply matrices on GPUs to speed up both &amp;ldquo;old&amp;rdquo; CV filters (which are essentially convolutions) and use deep learning inference (yes, you can do it in opencv with the special module added).</description>

      <description>In tensorflow 1.0, you had to define your model as a graph, and run it using the following syntax:
with tf.Session(...) as sess: sess.run(...) This piece of code basically compiles a graph and puts it on the device that it should be executed on (CPU/GPU).
While compiling the graph, TensorFlow applies various optimizations, like running parallel branches in separate threads, etc. So, as a result, you could expect a better performance of the resulting model.</description>

      <description>Intro If you&amp;rsquo;re driving a car you&amp;rsquo;ve probably seen the On-Board Diagnostics port (OBD for short) under the steering wheel. That is a standardized interface for accessing the vehicle&amp;rsquo;s diagnostic information. It&amp;rsquo;s typically used by mechanics and diagnostic tools to retrieve data related to the engine, transmission, and other essential systems. They usually use some manufacturer-approved hardware. What makes it interesting is that we can read data from almost any major device in the vehicle and even control some of them.</description>
